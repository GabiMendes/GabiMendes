### Hello there 👋
My name is Gabriela and I’m studying Systems Analysis.

🌱 My name is Gabriela and I study Systems Analysis.

🔭 I am a teacher, graduated in Letters (licentiate) and I share between both courses the passion for Languages, besides loving to build in a team, whether in a company or in a classroom.

💬 Chatty, I love a good conversation, especially if it is accompanied by a little mug of coffee (it can be cold or hot, okay?)

<br>

⚡ Some curiosities about me:

Favorite movie: “PS: I Love You”, and I’ve watched it at least twenty times. This is not an exaggeration.

Favorite book: “The Silver Linings Playbook”, and the number of times I’ve read it doesn’t differ much from the number of times I’ve seen the movie above.

Great, great game: “Don’t Starve”, and I may have already played this game more than twenty times, but it’s still very cool to survive and collaborate as a team.

⚡ Get to know some of my skills: <br> <br> Back-end/Web <br> <br> C, Python, Go, TypeScript, PHP, Java, JavaScript <br> <br> Front-end <br> <br> React, TypeScript, JavaScript <br> <br> Frameworks <br> <br> Next.js, Flask
